# Velociraptors
We introduce Turtle Sim like feature in our code. Which means by clicking one button on remote control the whole code of such function runs and the bot follows the path. for example if user press square on remote contol bot completed square on its own and stops after completng. We add square, circle, eight and star which run perfectly and rotate by perfect angle.
Welcome to the Velociraptors wiki!

## Brief Summary about our bot - 
### We added a turtleSim-like function in our bot means we added four buttons to our remote control square, circle, eight, and star. By clicking any one of them, bot follows the respective path and complete shape. We also create a design that covers our electrical circuit which we add in our google photos. At any time when bot topples, our circuit remains safe and it helps us in many aspects. All trial runs are done by our bot and our bot topples much time on the path by conveners but it neither harms our circuit. We also add spacers between esp32, l293d, and bot structure because it always insulates and looks good.
## Motivation for the idea and XLR* journey - 
### We get an idea of turtleSim from the mentor. We discuss the idea about the upper cover and topple problem and introduce the structure with good design from waste cardboard.
## Resources used - 
### We go through datasheets of ESP32 and L293D and gather all information from different websites. On research, we also get to know that if we select less rpm motor we get greater torque which helps to add a robotic arm on the bot.
## Electrical Circuit
### We design our electric circuit on circuit.io and I added a photo of the same in google Photos. But we go through datasheets of esp32, L293D and get much data about the equipment. And finally, we design our circuit on the breadboard but it has many loopholes, we solve it line by line and finally, we were ready with our circuit.
## Code for ESP32 and Web page - 
### I add code in the code section.
## Help received from a mentor - 
### Our mentor helps us in many aspects. He gives an idea about turtleSim like function and we code it. He always responsive to us in any doubts. Our team is really thankful to our mentor (Darshan).
